# Holberton School - 0x1D-Search Algorithms
This project, for Holberton School, focuses on search algorithms. Looking specifically at a linear search versus a binary search, and the time complexity of each. All algorithms are written in C.

## Description of Files
<h4>0-linear.c</h4>
A linear search written in C. Time complexity is O(n), or linear, because there's the potential to go through every element in the given array.
<h4>1-binary.c</h4>
A binary search written in C. Time complexity is O(log(n)) because the array is searched by dividing in half and checking the value at that location, and continuing until the correct value is found. This only works on sorted data.
