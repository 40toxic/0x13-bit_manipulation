# Holberton School Low Level Programming

This repository contains all of the projects done for Holberton School's Low Level Programming track. All of the projects are written in C. The projects follow a styling guide provided for students lovingly known as <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty">Betty</a>. All projects are created to run on Ubuntu 14.04 and compiled with the command `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic`.
